<!-- 
  self hosted plausible analytics - a privacy friendly analytics service

  why the script element building?
  
  all our external sources are downloaded and self-hosted by mkdocs automatically
  great overall, but this behavior broke our self-hosted plausible, so we had to workaround it   
  more info: https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material/pull/6502 

  this file overwrites the original analytics.html file mkdocs-material:
  https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material/blob/master/src/templates/partials/integrations/analytics.html
  which is included in base.html:
  https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material/blob/master/src/templates/base.html
  it's cleaner to just overwrite analytics.html than to copy paste the full base.html and then only overwrite a small part
