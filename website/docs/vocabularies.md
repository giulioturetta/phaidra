# Vocabularies

Most of the vocabularies which are frequently used are listed in [phaidra-ui store](https://github.com/phaidra/phaidra/blob/main/src/phaidra-vue-components/src/store/modules/vocabulary.js).

There you can find the list of object types, roles, licenses, etc.

The identifiers in the vocabularies are mostly URIs pointing either to known external vocabularies or PHAIDRA's vocabulary server, which is currently an [iQvoc instance](https://vocab.phaidra.org/vocabulary).
