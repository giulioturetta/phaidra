# How to contribute
First of all, thank you for your interest in contributing to PHAIDRA!

## Issues
You find PHAIDRA could be enhanced with a new feature? You set up PHAIDRA and something is not working as you would expect it to work? Please let us know and file an issue!  To keep things uncluttered, we for now just set up two templates, namely a *Bug Report* and a *Feature request*.  If you find a security-related issue, please file it as a bug report!

## Code

The way to contribute code is pretty much straight forward and does not differ from other git projects:

  1. Create a fork of this repository.
  2. Clone the fork to your local machine. Make sure to regularely update to stay in sync with our development.
  3. Mod and test the code until you reach your goal using clear commit messages.
  4. Push the commits to your fork.
  5. Create a pull request with a clear description of what your code is intended to do/fix/enhance.
  6. Please be patient, we trust our contributors, however we need to properly review and test the code before we merge.
