# How to contribute
First of all, thank you for your interest in contributing to PHAIDRA!

The way to contribute is pretty much straight forward and does not differ from other git projects:
  1. Create a fork of this repository.
  2. Clone the fork to your local machine. Make sure to regularely update to stay in sync with our development.
  3. Mod and test the code until you reach your goal using clear commit messages.
  4. Push the commits to your fork.
  5. Create a pull request with a clear description of what your code is intended to do/fix/enhance.
  6. Please be patient, we trust our contributors, however we need to properly review and test the code before we merge.
